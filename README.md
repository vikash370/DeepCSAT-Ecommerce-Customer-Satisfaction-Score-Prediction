PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
In the e-commerce sector, understanding customer satisfaction is critical but traditionally slow. 
Businesses rely on post-interaction surveys, which are often delayed, have low response rates, and are reactive. 
This means by the time a bad experience is reported, the customer is already dissatisfied.

This project solves this by creating a proactive early warning system. 
By analyzing a customer's raw text feedback (like a chat message or a support remark) as it happens, this model instantly predicts their satisfaction score, allowing the business to identify and help unhappy customers before they churn.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack:- 
  1. Backend & Modeling: Python 3.11, TensorFlow (Keras)

  2. Web Framework: Streamlit

  3. Data Processing: Pandas, NLTK (for text preprocessing), Scikit-learn

  4. Deployment: Streamlit Community Cloud (streamlit.io)

üß† Project Methodology
   1. Data Preparation: Loaded the eCommerce_Customer_support_data.csv dataset.

   2. Text Preprocessing (NLP): Cleaned the Customer Remarks text by:
      Converting to lowercase.
      Removing punctuation and numbers.
      Removing common stopwords (e.g., 'the', 'is', 'a').
      Lemmatizing words to their root form (e.g., 'running' -> 'run').

   3. Feature Engineering: Used the Keras Tokenizer to convert the cleaned text into numerical sequences, which were then padded to a uniform length.

   4. Model Development: Built and trained a Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. This type of network is excellent at understanding the context of a sentence by reading it both forwards and backward.

   5. Deployment: The final trained model (.h5) and tokenizer (.json) were saved and are used to power the Streamlit web app.
